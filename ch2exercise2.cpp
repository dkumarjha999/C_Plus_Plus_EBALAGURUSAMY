  then using if condition we are finding which is bigger number
  
  if we use to check conditions and it gives boolean result true or false based on that it execute if or else
  
  it is not necessary we need to keep else always with if conditions also if we have multiple coditions we can use multiple if
  
  using else is our choice based on need.
