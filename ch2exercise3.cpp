  this program is for printing WELL DONE n times
  
  for doing any work n number of thimes that is repeated work then we use loop
  
  we can use for loop
  
  which has 3 part 1) initialization here we initialize the iterating variable 2) condition for execution 3) increment or decrement
  
  here step 1 and 3 are optional but 2 must be there
  
  
   or we can use while loop
  
  here based on one variable until condition in while is correct it executes
  
  or we can use DO while loop
  
  in do while loop first it executes once do condition then it goess for checking while condition for looping the do part again
